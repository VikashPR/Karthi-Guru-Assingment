					<h2>HISTORY</h2>
					<p>History of Golden Temple</p>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Golden Temple is also known as Sri Harmandir Sahab and Sri Darbar Sahab. Guru Arjun Dev, the
						fifth Sikh Guru, gave the idea of construction of a temple where Sikhs can come and worship. The
						land for the temple was bought from the Zamindars by Guru Ramdas. Hazrat Mian Mir Ji, a Muslim
						saint, laid the foundation of the temple and the construction was supervised by Guru Arjun Dev.
						The guru asked to build the temple at a lower level with four gates, one in each direction. The
						construction of the temple was started in 1588 and completed in 1601. Guru Granth Sahib was also
						installed by Guru Arjun Dev and Baba Budha ji was appointed as the first reader of the book. The
						temple has got the status of Ath Sath Tirth and Sikhs from various places come here for
						pilgrimage.</p>

					<h2>ARCHITECTURE</h2>
					<p>Architecture of golden temple</p>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>The Golden Temple's architecture reflects different architectural practices prevalent in the
						Indian subcontinent, as various iterations of temple were rebuilt and restored. The Temple is
						described by Ian Kerr, and other scholars, as a mixture of the Indo-Islamic Mughal and the Hindu
						Rajput architecture.

						The sanctum is a 12.25 x 12.25 metre square with two-storeys and a gold foil dome. This sanctum
						has a marble platform that is a 19.7 x 19.7 metre square. It sits inside an almost square (154.5
						x 148.5 m2) pool called amritsar or amritsarovar . The pool is 5.1 metre deep and is surrounded
						by a 3.7 metre wide
						circumambulatory marble passage that is circled clockwise. Bathing in the pool is believed by
						many
						Sikhs to have restorative powers, purifying one's karma. </p>
